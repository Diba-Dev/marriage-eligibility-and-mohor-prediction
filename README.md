# Predicting Marriage Eligibility and Mohor Value Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project applies Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to predict:
- **Marriage Eligibility** (Classification)
- **Mohor Value** (Regression)

The system uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze structured data and produce accurate predictions.

---

## Problem Statement
Marriage eligibility and Mohor value decisions often depend on multiple personal, social, and economic factors.  
This project aims to build a data-driven system that can assist in predicting eligibility and estimating Mohor value using historical data.

---

## Features
- Binary classification for marriage eligibility
- Regression model for Mohor value prediction
- ANN and CNN based deep learning models
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model evaluation and performance analysis

---

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Kaggle 
- Google Colab
